# Demonstration of `blob:` URLs leaking memory in WebKit

## Revoking `blob:` URLs does not adequately free the memory they point to

**Meaning a window/tab will eventually crash from memory exhaustion after navigating around enough to create and revoke too many `blob:` URLs.**

## Setup

To run a small web server for this project, use any simple server you like or:

```sh
npx serve
```

which will listen on port `:3000` on `localhost` by default.

### The test

üëâ Navigate to the test app, ex: `http://localhost:3000/` or if you are browsing from your phone, ex: `http://10.1.1.10:3000/`

The code in this repo will create and revoke `blob:` URLs for Unsplash thumbnails in batches of 100. One can choose how many batches (pages), and if you want to see the images visually or not. 

The default settings are enough to crash a tab in mobile Safari on my iPhone 14 Pro running 16.4.1 ‚Äì it consistently crashes after 52‚Äì54 batches.

Testing an iPhone SE running 15.7.6, it consistently crashes after 30‚Äì32 batches.

Choosing to render the images causes mobile Safari to crash in around half the time. The iPhone SE device I have consistently crashes after 15‚Äì18 batches when choosing to render the `img`s visually as part of the test. **However, it is not a required for the `blob:` URLs to be rendered** to crash mobile Safari, it just speeds up the process.

### How do I know the tab crashed in mobile Safari?

The tab will reload itself. When the test is running, the ‚ÄúRun tests‚Äù button is disabled. If the button is suddenly enabled and the in-page logs are gone, then the tab has reloaded. _If the tests were to complete without crashing, ‚ÄúDone. Succeeded.‚Äù will be logged to the page so it should be clear._

I recommend connecting to the phone‚Äôs Safari‚Äôs devtools from macOS Safari to see what the last logs were before it crashed. You can also profile the memory growth on your device and see how high it goes before it crashes. _The iPhone 14 Pro device here got up to 1.65GB of ‚Äúpage‚Äù memory once, for example._

### Expected outcome

It is expected that revoked `blob:` URLs go away, and do not continue to contribute to the total memory size of the page.

## Why does this matter?

For an SPA designed to display images using `blob:` URLs, the app is a ticking time bomb üí£ 

It will crash after the customer has navigated around to enough pages of images to leak enough memory. An SPA designed to be left open all day could reach the memory exhaustion point days after it‚Äôs initially opened, which makes debugging and reproducing super difficult.

One can imagine an E2EE photo sharing app, similar to Flickr or Glass, built as an SPA, which needs to use `blob:` URLs to display images after they are downloaded and decrypted, and which would have consistent crashes for mobile Safari customers as they navigate between profiles and pages of images.

This basically means: **one cannot safely use `blob:` URLs in an SPA.**

## Screenshots

### Memory growth when creating then revoking `blob:` URLs (not displayed on screen, just created and then revoked):

The tab crashed at this point and the devtools connection was lost.

### Memory growth when creating, providing as the `src` of an `img`, then revoking `blob:` URLs:

The tab crashed at this point and the devtools connection was lost.
